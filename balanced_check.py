"""
This simple algorithm uses a stack and is as follows:
Make an empty stack.
Read characters until end of file.
If the character is an opening symbol:
    push it onto the stack.
If it is a closing symbol:
    then if the stack is empty report an error.
    Otherwise, pop the stack.
If the symbol popped is not the corresponding opening symbol:
    then report an error.
At end of file, if the stack is not empty:
    report an error.

Runs on linear time and makes only one pass through the input.
Extra work can be done to attempt to decide what to do when an error is reportedâ€”such as
identifying the likely cause.

Examples:
([]{}) is balanced.
({[]}) is balanced.
([)] is not balanced.
(} is not balanced.
()} is not balanced.
({} is not balanced.
